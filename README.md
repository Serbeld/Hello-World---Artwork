## First step

I made a painting writing ">HELLO WORLD" on a piece of paper and I took a photo of the painting.

<img src="Hellooo.jpg"/>

## Second step 

I made a binarization of the image to get the texture of the image in black and white with the BINSergio.py code file.

<img src="HelloWorld_HD.png"/>

## Third step

I created a video with a text background in a loop "Hello World By Sergio Beleño" with the HelloWorld.py code file.

<img src="Hello World.png"/>

## Fourth step

I created the final video adding an intro and overlapping the image with the loop video.
